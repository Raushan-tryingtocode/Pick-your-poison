# 🧪 Pick Your Poison: Media Hub

A high-concept, "Cyber-Toxic" themed dashboard for discovering and categorizing East Asian media (Manga, Manhwa, Manhua, and Anime). This project was built to master **CSS Layouts**, **Glassmorphism**, and **UI Responsiveness**.

## 🚀 Live Features
- **Frosted Glass UI:** Implemented using `backdrop-filter` and `rgba` transparency for a modern aesthetic.
- **Dynamic Dropdown:** A hover-activated navigation menu built with pure CSS.
- **Responsive Media Table:** A styled data table featuring zebra-striping and hover highlights for easy content tracking.
- **Parallax Background:** A fixed-position custom wallpaper with "cover" scaling to fit all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **CSS3:** Custom styling, Flexbox logic, and advanced filters.
